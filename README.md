# planetscope_download
Python scripts for downloading Planetscope scenes

Order is placed using REST calls to planet api.
Run all the cells in the jupyter notebook to place order.
Modify scene parameters as required.

Download script runs at the moment only on unix shells, uses subprocess to call wget, etc.
To achieve the same in window, modify the script to copy the URL of the order and run using wget, curl or just paste in browser.
